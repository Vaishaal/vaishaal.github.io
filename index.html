<p> I am a research scientist with the Machine Learning Research group at Apple. </p>

  <p>
  I am broadly interested in the <b> foundations of machine learning </b> 
  My work has recently been focused on the interplay between dataset design, multi-modality and distributional robustness. I have been fortunate to be 
  a part of the <a href="https://github.com/modestyachts/ImageNetV2"> ImageNetV2 </a> and <a href="https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip"> OpenCLIP </a> projects.
  </p>


<p> Previously I spent 9 wonderful years at UC berkeley and had the pleasure of working with <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/"> Ben Recht </a>, <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/ludwigs/"> Ludwig Schmidt </a> 
  <a href="http://ericjonas.com/"> Eric Jonas </a>, <a href="https://shivaram.org/"> Shivaram Venkataraman </a> and many other brilliant researchers.
